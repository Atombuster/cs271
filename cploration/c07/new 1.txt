Continuing in symtable.h, let's define our structure to 
represent a single data item//

Let's call it Symbol.//

This structure will group a string (the name) and a hack_addr (the address).

We will use it to lookup an address (value) given the string name (key).

Adapt the DataItem from the tutorial to match the structure describes above. 

Make sure to select the right types. 

And change the variable names to name and addr to suit our program.
